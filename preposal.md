## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Ideas include a game of blackjack but with special rules. Even value number cards (2,4,6..) are doubled in value each time you draw one. Also, face cards (J, Q, K) add 10 but divides your total by 2 and rounds up (only divides on first hit). Another rule is that if you stop and the number of cards in your hand are even you can add 1 to your total. On the other hand if it is odd you can subract 1. Winning without using this feature gives more points than if you. Example: Your starting hand is a 6 and 9 (total:15). You draw a 2 which stays the same value (total:17). Then you draw a J which adds 10 (total:27) but divided by 2 and rounded (total:14). Now you draw a 4 that now doubles to become 8 (total:22). You end with 5 cards in ur hand so you can subtract 1 from your total or stay (total:21).
