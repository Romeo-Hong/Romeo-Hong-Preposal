# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Ideas include a Discord bot that plays blackjack but even value number cards (2,4,6..) are doubled in value each time you draw one. Also, face cards (J, Q, K) add 10 but divides your total by 2 and rounds up (only divides on first hit). Another rule is that if you stop and the number of cards in your hand are even you can add 1 to your total. Example: Your starting hand is a 6 and 9 (total:15). You draw a 2 which stays the same value (total:17). Then you draw a J which adds 10 (total:27) but divided by 2 and rounded (total:14). Now you draw a 4 that now doubles to become 8 (total:22). Ends in an even number so you can subract 1 and get a total of 21.
